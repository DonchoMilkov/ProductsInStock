# ProductsInStock
ProductsInStock is a simple web page built using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.
Products are represented as rows in Html table.
Each product has been included in the html as a table row by a 'for loop' through the product list.
If a product is out of stock the row with its data gets additional class to be styled differently.
Each row recieves an on-click event handler that executes function "drawProductInfo" which shows detailed product view
